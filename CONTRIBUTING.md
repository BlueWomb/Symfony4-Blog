This is simply a test project to explore the potential of the most recent implementation of one of the most popular web application development frameworks and to code a concrete application. I don't pretend to teach anyone anything or to create the new WordPress. The fact remains that if you find it interesting and useful to add something to the project and share some valuable advice (in compliance with the <a href="https://github.com/BlueWoom/Symfony4.3-Blog/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>), I will be more than happy.
